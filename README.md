# **SimpleDeathChest**
### Simple, Efficient, and maybe reliable Minecraft plugin.

## How does it work?
1. When a player dies, a chest is created in their place.
2. All of their items are deposited onto the chest.
3. That's it!

## Some interesting features:
- All items fit in the chest! 
  - As there's an special inventory that has 45 total slots, so no items will be lost!
- No chest farming over here... 
  - Death chests are not dropped when broken
- Hold up, is it empty?
  - A death chest cannot be broken unless it's empty
- Am I too far down?
  - When died by the void in the end, the chest will still appear, but in y = 1

> [!CAUTION]
> This is my first plugin made for minecraft, there might be errors, bugs, and maybe an occasional crash in you server, it has not been fully tested.
