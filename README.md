# **SimpleDeathChest**
### Simple, Efficient, and maybe reliable Minecraft plugin.

This plugin is simple, a chest that will appear once a player dies, and store their inventory contents.
This chest cannot be broken unless it's empty. Some unintended mechanics can be found, like making a chest farm by repeatedly dying... We shall see how that is figured out in the future.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is my first plugin made for minecraft, there might be errors, bugs, and maybe an occasional crash in you server, it has not been fully tested.
